Instructions for reproducibility

I am not allowed to share a direct link to the files here, so you will have to download the files yourself.

You can download it here: https://github.com/echonet/dynamic

Their github has further instructions for you to follow. After you have downloaded the data, make sure you paste it here and unzip it (use "unzip here" if you use winrar).

Expected file structure:

EchoNet-Dynamic/
    Videos/
        videos.avi (bunch of videos in avi format)
FileList.csv
VolumeTracings.csv
